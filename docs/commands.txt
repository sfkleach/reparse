Reparse - List of Commands
==========================

Copy
----
This command copies from one column to another. Typically the target column
will be a named column. Named columns persist until overwritten by another
copy and can be used to capture meta-data.

	Copy: From=[1], To=[Date]

Done
----
This command checks that the end of input has been reached - otherwise it
raises an exception.

Entry
-----
See Table.

Header
------
TBD

Output
------
This command determines the kind of output that is generated.

The keyword argument "Format" can take values "CSV" and "JSON". Other values
will raise an error.
e.g. 

	Output: Format="JSON"

Pass
----
This is the 'null' command that does nothing. It has no parameters. The only
use for this command is to allow script writers the ability to explicitly
describe a lack of action.

Print
-----
Syntax:

	Print

This command causes a record to be sent to the output. It has no parameters
and no options.

Print-Repeat
------------
TBD

Require
-------
Syntax:

	Require REGEX
		COMMANDS

The Require command matches the next input line against the regex REGEX, 
raising an error if no match is possible. Then the commands COMMANDS are
executed with the match-groups bound.

Table and Entry
---------------
Syntax:

	Table: Name=NAME [, Error=MESSAGE]
    Entry: Match=REGEX, Value=STRING

The Table command sets up a new table with the given name that can be
used in a Transform with the Use-Table action. Entries are added using the
Entry command, which adds a match-rule to the current Table. Entries are
ordered and are used in sequence.

A Table may also specify what should happen when a value is supplied that
does not match any entry. If the optional Error keyword is present, it means
that the lookup should fail with that error message. If it is absent then
the original value should be used.

(Error handling and validation will be improved in the next cycle.)

Transform
---------
Syntax:

	Transform COLUMN: FILTER, ...

The Transform command applies a series of 'filters' (i.e. transformations) to a 
named column or all columns. 

Example:

	# All columns.
	Transform[*]: Trim

	# Just the first column.
	Transform[1]: Lowercase

The filters that are available are:

  * Trim
  * Uppercase
  * Lowercase
  * Use-Table=NAME, which applies the named table.

Until
-----

	Until REGEX [ : At-End=Break ]
		COMMANDS

The Until command loops matches the next input line against the regex 
REGEX, stopping if no match is possible, otherwise executing the commands 
COMMANDS with the match-groups bound.

If the At-End=Break option is set then the loop will break if the end of input
is encountered rather than a match for REGEX.
