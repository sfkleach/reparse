Reparse - Script Syntax
=======================

Literal Strings
---------------
Strings are enclosed in double-quotes.

Literal Regexs
--------------
Literal regexs are enclosed in // ... // pairs.

Comments
--------
Scripts use the hash (#) character to introduce end of line comments. Note that
comments do not contribute to indentation; a line that is just an indented
comment is discarded.

Indentation
-----------
Indentation is used to determine nesting. 

Commands
--------
A script consists primarily of a series of commands that are executed in 
sequence. Each command starts with an Action and then has zero or more 
positional arguments followed by zero or more keyword arguments. 

	Command ::= Action PositionalArguments? ( ':' KeywordArguments )?
	PositionalArguments ::= Expression ( ',' PositionalArguments )?
	KeywordArguments ::= Keyword ( '=' Expression )? ( ',' KeywordArguments )?
	Action ::= 'Done'| 'Header' | 'Pass' | 'Print-Repeat' | 'Print'
			 | 'Output' | 'Require' | 'Until'
