Overview of Reparse's Script Language
=====================================

Literal Strings
---------------
Strings are enclosed in double-quotes.

Literal Regexs
--------------
Literal regexs are enclosed in // ... // pairs.

Comments
--------
Scripts use the hash (#) character to introduce end of line comments. Note that
comments do not contribute to indentation; a line that is just an indented
comment is discarded.

Indentation
-----------
Indentation is used to determine nesting. 

Commands
--------
A script consists primarily of a series of commands that are executed in 
sequence. Each command starts with an Action and then has zero or more 
positional arguments followed by zero or more keyword arguments. Keyword
arguments can be given in any order.

	Command ::= Action PositionalArguments? ( ':' KeywordArguments )?
	PositionalArguments ::= Expression ( ',' PositionalArguments )?
	KeywordArguments ::= Keyword ( '=' Expression )? ( ',' KeywordArguments )?
	Action ::= 'Done'| 'Entry' | Header' | 'Pass' | 'Print-Repeat' | 'Print'
			 | 'Output' | 'Require' | 'Table' | Until'

See link:commands.html[Commands] for the syntax of each command and 
link:grammar.html[Grammar] for the formal grammar.
